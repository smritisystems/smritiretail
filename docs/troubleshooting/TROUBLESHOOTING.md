# SMRITI Retail OS — Troubleshooting & Support Manual

This document details common operational issues and resolutions.

---

## 1. CRM Server Sync Discrepancies
- **Symptom:** Customers modified in the CRM tab do not show up immediately in other registers.
- **Cause:** Network offline state or pending sync queue failure.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Verify the network status in the browser console.
  2. If the browser shows offline, verify that mutations are saved in the `smriti_pending_customers` local storage array.
  3. Re-establish network connectivity to trigger automated online queue synchronization.

## 2. Keyboard Shortcut Collisions
- **Symptom:** Pressing F12 launches browser DevTools instead of executing standard checkout.
- **Cause:** Browser default hotkeys taking precedence.
- **Resolution:** The POS terminal calls `e.preventDefault()` to intercept keys. Ensure the focus resides inside the active viewport window of the POS application tab.

## 3. Split Payment Ledger Discrepancies
- **Symptom:** Total debits in General Ledger do not balance with sales invoice.
- **Cause:** Incomplete split payment breakdown payload.
- **Resolution:** Check `/api/pos/checkout` request logs. The payment mode must be set to `"Split"` with a valid `breakup` mapping.
